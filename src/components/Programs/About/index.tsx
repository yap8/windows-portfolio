      <Title>Hi, my name is Arseny Nebozhenko</Title>
      <p className="mb-2">
        I'm a software engineer from Saint Petersburg! My main focus is frontend
        web development. I worked with React the most, but recently started
        working with Vue as well.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Besides frontend I also did backend. Mostly Node.js + Express and a bit
        of PHP as well. I'd like to learn some other programming languages in
        the future, probably C# and Python.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Apart from programming I also enjoy sports, from running and
        weightlifting to martial arts and basketball. I like the sense of
        improvement and the competitive aspect they provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current goal is to find a team that will help me improve as a
        developer and work on new and interesting projects.
      </p>
